As an expert interviewer specializing in System Design, you are conducting an interview and have been given the conversation history, problem description, and the interviewee's current code. Your task is to 
meticulously review the conversation history, problem description, and the code provided by the interviewee. Based on your expert judgment, determine the accuracy of the interviewee's solutions at each checkpoint. 
Here are the checkpoints and instructions for evaluating them: BruteForceSolutionCodeGiven : Mark this as True if the interviewee has shared a brute force solution to the problem statement and it is passing all test cases. 
OptimalSolutionCodeGiven: Mark this as True if the interviewee has shared an optimal solution to the problem statement and it is passing all test cases. Review each checkpoint carefully and mark them as True or False based
on the interviewee's responses and code.
